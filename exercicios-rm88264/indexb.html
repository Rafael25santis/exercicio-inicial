    <h1>Angra - The Shadow Hunter</h1>
    <p>I remember the blood on his hands<br>
    So ashamed regretting his faults<br>
    So defenseless he came from the darkness<br>
    We spoke and had a good talk Dark old hat reminds me of someone<br><br>
    I find hard to recall<br>
    Bowed his head surrendering to sorrow<br>
    Wears the face of war<br><br>
    Desperate cries<br><br>
    Running in circles<br>
    (Mourning in vain) Resigning to terror<br>
    (A sinful warfare) A sinful warfare (Innocents die)<br>
    Lost in the faith from my fragile heart<br>
    From my heart<br><br>
    Wearing black, a bow without arrows<br>
    God, have mercy on his soul<br>
    Eyes of dread, entrenched in horror<br>
    My devotions are gone!<br><br>
    Running in circles<br>
    (Mourning in vain) Resigning to terror<br>
    (A sinful warfare) Atrocious attack (Atrocious attack)<br>
    My crusader's faith<br>
    Drowns in religious blood<br>
    But I'll fight 'til the end<br>
    Gonna find my Holy Grail<br><br>
    Running blind against the faith<br>
    Reason slips away<br>
    Churches falling like castles on the sand<br>
    Ends the Holy War, have the good for bad<br><br>
    What does a man gain from his work?<br>
    Under the sun where he labors<br>
    What is so good for a man in life?<br>
    During his days he's just like a shadow<br><br>
    Vanitas! Vanitas! Utters the oracle<br>
    A chasing after the wind<br>
    Meaningless! Meaningless searches for wisdom<br>
    Everything is in vain like your hunting for shadows<br><br>
    Lost my pride, fought in vain<br>
    Had to find<br>
    Reasons to my pain... Oh!<br><br>
    Running blind against the faith<br>
    Running blind again<br>
    Church is falling like castles on the sand<br>
    Ends the Holy War, Jesus was a man<br><br>
    With a heart, with a mind<br>
    With a body, with a soul<br><br>
    So divine as your own<br><br>
    God has no mind, has no heart<br>
    Has no body, has no soul<br>
    And no resemblance of you<br><br>
    No! (Like chasing the wind)<br>
    (Like chasing the wind)<br>
    (Like chasing the wind)<br>
    (Like chasing...)</p>

        "No mundo dos negócios todos são pagos com duas<br />
        moedas: Dinheiro e experiência. Agarre a experiência<br />
        primeiro, o dinheiro virá depois." -- Harold Geneen

        "Há homens que lutam um dia e são bons.<br/>
        Há outros que lutam muitos dias esão melhores.<br>
        Mas há os que lutam toda a vida, e estes são<br>
        imprescindiveis."<br><br>
